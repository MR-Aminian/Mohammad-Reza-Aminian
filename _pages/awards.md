Extracurricular Activities
--------------------------

Some of my hobbies are: 

* swimming, 
* hiking, 
* cycling,
* table tennis,
* ecotourism,
* watching movie and anime,
* and last but definitely not least, traveling! 

I have always been a math enthusiast - alongside my other interests - and because of that I attended several math competitions both nationally as well as internationally, and, most importantly, got to enjoy visiting quite a few other countries!
