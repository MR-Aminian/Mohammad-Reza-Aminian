Welcome to my personal academic website. I'm Mohammad Reza, a 2nd year Ph.D. student in the Management Sciences / Operations Management area at the University of Chicago, Booth School of Business, where I am very glad to have Prof. Rad Niazadeh as my advisor. Prior to that, I received my B.Sc. degrees in both Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from Sharif University of Technology. 



Research Interests
------------------

Broadly speaking, my research interests are in CS (TCS & Learning), Operations, and Economics (micro). In particular, I am passionate about such areas as (Online) Algorithms, Game Theory, Learning Theory (Online Learning), and Optimization. 


Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).
